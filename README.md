# Order of Ops
## Focus
This program was created as a way to solidify **infix -> postfix** expression and express it in code.  I've also always wanted to make a more complicated calculator.
## Description
The program begins by asking for an algebraic expression from the user in the form of a string.  It then tests this string te see if it is a valid algebraic expression
and then converts the string from infix to postfix.  From there it simply resolves the postfix expression to give you the result.
## Misc info
This program was written in **C#** and took __roughly__ 12 hours to make.
## Special thanks
Special thanks to Ken Meads for giving me the idea to code this, and stress testing it and breaking it many, many times.
Special thanks to Andrew Brimm for initially teaching me infix to postfix in his well taught CS class.
